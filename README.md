## 1. Introduction

Clearly describe the purpose and functionality of your app. Provide brief
instructions on how to use your app, including any necessary configuration

## 2. Design Rationale

Discuss the architectural and design choices made during the
development of your app. This could include, but is not limited to, the decision to use
Activities vs. Fragments, the choice of layout and views (e.g., LinearLayout,
ConstraintLayout), and the use of specific data storage solutions (e.g., Preferences
DataStore or Content Providers). Justify these decisions based on the requirements and
the expected user experience.

## 3. Novel Features

If your app includes innovative or unique features that distinguish it
from typical applications, describe them here. Detail how these features enhance the
user experience or improve the appâ€™s functionality. If your app does not incorporate
novel features, you may omit this section.

## 4. Challenges and Future Improvements

Reflect on the challenges encountered during
the development process and how you addressed them. Additionally, propose potential
improvements or additional features that could be implemented in future versions of
the app to enhance its functionality, performance, or user experience
